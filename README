Simplex Repeater
===================

A repeater is a device which allows amateur radio operators to talk beyond the range of their small hand held radios. It is usualy a raido placed in an area with great coverage and used to exploit that coverage.

This repeater records and then plays back the receive transmission, like a parot. It aleviates the need for the equipment needed for full-duplex radios.

We use portaduio and yaml, in an attempt to be as platform agnostic as possible however we are currently developing on fedora.

Current Goals
==============

* Record voice and playback
* ID every so often
